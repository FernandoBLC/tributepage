            <p>He is a Canadian actor, a person who has had a great impact within society and the community even of the games... 
                (Being Cyberpunk 2077 called CyberBUGS). He is a person I admire for his way of being, since he has lived 
                different stages in which he was able to get up and shows that everything one proposes can be achieved and 
                overcome with effort.
